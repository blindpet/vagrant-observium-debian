Quick and dirty [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) envrionment for working on [Observium](http://www.observium.org).
Adapted so bootstrap.sh will also work without vagrant.


## Usage
Assuming you already have virtualbox and vagrant installed...

1. git clone https://github.com/blindpet/vagrant-observium-debian
2. cd vagrant-observium-debian
3. vagrant up
4. check it out:
 * Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8080 and log in as admin with password admin
 * Or log in with ssh: vagrant ssh
